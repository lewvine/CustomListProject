As a developer, I want to write documentation in a .txt file that describes the details and
functionality of my – operator overload. I want to include details such as “syntax”, “parameters”,
“return type”, and an example of it being used, with the output

CustomList<T> - operator

Subtracts the elements from "list a" that are found in "list b" using the following format:
list a - list b.



Parameters
CustomList a, CustomList b
Uses two CustomList objects as parameters.

Returns:
CustomList a
Returns an updated "list a" with the specified elements removed. 

Example:
	CustomList<string> a = new CustomList<int>(){ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
	CustomList<string> b = new CustomList<int>(){ 2, 3, 4, 4 } 

	//Actual implementation of -operator
            for(int i = 0; i < a.count; i++)
            {
                foreach(T item in b._items)
                {
                    if(a._items[i].Equals(item))
                    {
                        a.Remove(item);
                    }
                }
            }
            return a;

	a._items = [ 1, 5 ];
